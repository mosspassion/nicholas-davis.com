            Nicholas Davis (b. 1985) was raised in the Seattle, WA area, where he played music in bands instead of going to college. He moved to Chicago in 2010 where he co-founded a <a href="http://outsideforces-blog.tumblr.com/">collective of musicians</a> dedicated to improvised music, and was a DJ on NUMBERS.FM. He then received a BFA from <a href="http://www.saic.edu">SAIC</a> focusing on sound art, performance art, and creative coding. He is currently a member of <a href="http://meeklingpress.com/">Meekling Press</a>, a member of <a href="http://github.com/Pwnbrewclub">Pwnbrew Club</a>, and a part of the national Killer Queen Arcade community.

            ARTIST STATEMENT
            <br>
            The artworks I make come in the forms of conceptual sound composition via computers and custom electronics, ritual-focused and socially engaging performance, interactive installations, and lyric essay. My works aim to redirect associative thought from sensory or cultural expectations with non-linear narrative, and atypical contextualization. I exploit the fleeting moments of change in systems in order to completely dismantle and reimagine, or to augment.
